 SerialCS
 ========

 SerialCS is a client/server package which let the client talk with a
 serial port through the server, without closing the serial connection
 between each exchange. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rationale
 =========

 When working on NanoWatchdog, I wanted talk with the Arduino board
 from the PC, and I first test with the arduino-serial program [1]. 
 But I soonly felt into the "auto-reset" feature of the Nano, 
 which reset the board each time the connection is opened.
 So the idea here is to have the server keep the connection to the
 serial bus opened, while the user interact with it through the client.
 This work is based on client/server examples [2].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The server
 ==========

 The server manages two communication streams:
 - with the client through a TCP socket:
 - with the serial bus.

 The principe is that commands sent by the client are redirected to
 the constantly opened serial bus, and all that is read from the serial
 bus is forwarded back to the client.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The client
 ==========

 The client is a simple command-line application which takes commands 
 from its input, send them to the server, and displays on its output
 all that is sent back by the server.
